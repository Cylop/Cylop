### Self thaugth and engaged Senior Full Stack Developer with 10+ years experience in Java

My journey began in 2011, writing my first line of code in Java. I started to create plugins for the popular game Minecraft and created multiple Networks with more than 400 concurrent Users playing my minigames. With that, I laid the stones for my career. A couple of years later, I started my apprenticeship as It-Technician in the hardware spectrum but never stopped programming in my free time. I coded everything from little 2D platformers to business applications, and I was constantly learning to take the next step. 
Last year, I worked 40 hours as a Developer for Amundi and CTO for a startup where I always created, adapted, and changed features. I implemented a standard for tracking features and ensuring that the code delivered to production had no code smell, was simple to understand, stable, and re-useable.

I am currently taking the next step with advancing in algorithms and problem solving to properly handle time and space to tickle every bit of resource out of a system.
